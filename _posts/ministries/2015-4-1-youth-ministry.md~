#        INSTRUCTIONS:
#       To edit, you can change the items after the colon.  The things before the colon, like "name" and "blurb"
#       are used by the website to tell what parts go in different places.  If you change that, the website will
#       get confused.  
# 
#       If you'd like to make a new ministry, the best way is to duplicate this file, then rename it with the same 
#       naming conventsions: YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md  The date isn't important, so you can just put in a fake date
#       like 1892-15-1-New-Ministry.md
# 
#       NOTES:
#       1. 'hero': This is the large image on the top of the ministries page.  
# 
#       2. 'blurb': This is the romance copy for the ministry. It needs to be indented once below the tag 'blurb:'  You can do
#                      do that by adding 4 spaces at the start of each new line.  Another way to do it is simply add the whole blurb
#                      on one line like this: "|blurb: Bacon ipsum dolor amet short ribs corned beef andouille, frankfurter chuck...etc."
#                      [NOTE: The same indenting conventions apply for testimonials no. 1-3.]
# 
#       3. 'testimonial-image': is the image of the testimonials. Be sure that it the file name of the image AND that the file is
#                      placed in the "img" folder of the main wac-cards directory.
# 
#       4. You have to place all of the contents of this file between the --- marks.  Anything outside of it won't be recognized.
# 
#       5. To delete a section, simply make a null value in the the variable added to the tag by adding empty qoutes "". 
#                      (e.g. testimonial-image1: "" & testimonial1: "")
