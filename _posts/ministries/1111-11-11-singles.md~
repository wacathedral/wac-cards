#        INSTRUCTIONS:
#       To edit, you can change the items after the colon.  The things before the colon, like "name" and "blurb"
#       are used by the website to tell what parts go in different places.  If you change that, the website will
#       get confused.  
# 
#       If you'd like to make a new ministry, the best way is to copy the contents of this file and add it to a new file in 
#       the "ministries" folder. That new folder needs a date and a title.  The date isn't important, so you can just put in 
#       a fake date like 1892-15-1-New-Ministry.md
# 
#       NOTES:
#       1. 'hero': This is the large image on the top of the ministries page.  
#       2. 'blurb': This is the romance copy for the ministry. It needs to be indented once below the tag 'blurb:'  You can do
#                      do that by adding 4 spaces at the start of each new line.  Another way to do it is simply add the whole blurb
#                      on one line like this: "|blurb: Bacon ipsum dolor amet short ribs corned beef andouille, frankfurter chuck...etc."
#       3. 'testimonial-image': is the image of the testimonials. Be sure that it the file name of the image AND that the file is
#                      placed in the "img" folder of the main wac-cards directory.
#       4. You have to place all of the contents of this file between the --- marks.  Anything outside of it won't be recognized.
